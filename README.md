This Notebook builds a logistic regression model, a type of statistical model used for classification, to predict the labels of the test set and then calculate the performance measures.
The dataset used is Haberman's Survival Dataset, which contains cases from a study conducted on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.
